Online Banking Program - Elite 102 Project

Objective: Users need to have an account number and PIN to identify themselves as owners of an account. Once users get into the system they will have standard options: check balance, deposit, and withdraw. Additionally, a new user or bank administrator can also create a new account, close account, and modify an account (such as edit name, PIN, or any other personal identification required to open an account).
